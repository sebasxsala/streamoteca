# Streamoteca

**Streamoteca** is an AI-powered movie and TV series discovery platform that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to deliver highly personalized content recommendations.

## Overview

This application combines modern web technologies with AI-driven features to create an intelligent streaming content discovery experience. Users can explore thousands of movies and TV shows, build personal watchlists, and receive recommendations tailored to their viewing preferences.

## Key Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Search

- **Vector Embeddings**: Search queries are transformed into semantic embeddings using Google Gemini's text-embedding model, enabling intelligent content matching beyond simple keyword searches
- **Hybrid Search**: Combines vector similarity with traditional text matching to deliver the most relevant results
- **Smart Caching**: Search embeddings are stored and reused to optimize performance and reduce API calls

### 🎯 Intelligent Recommendations

- **User Profile Embeddings**: The system analyzes user interactions (clicks, likes, watchlist additions) to build a personalized profile using weighted embeddings
- **Vector Similarity Matching**: Recommendations are generated by comparing user profiles against media embeddings, ensuring suggestions align with individual preferences
- **Interaction-Based Weighting**: Different actions carry different weights (e.g., likes count more than simple clicks) to better understand user intent

### 📊 Personalization System

- **Interaction Tracking**: Records user behavior to continuously improve recommendation accuracy
- **Custom Watchlists**: Users can save content for later viewing
- **Like System**: Express preferences to refine future recommendations
- **Genre-Based Filtering**: Explore content by specific genres with AI-enhanced sorting

### 🎨 Modern User Experience

- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- Real-time search with debouncing
- Infinite scroll pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Expandable movie cards with detailed information
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector similarity search
- **AI/ML**: Google Gemini AI for embedding generation
- **State Management**: React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js

## AI Implementation Details

The application uses **vector embeddings** as the foundation for its intelligent features:

1. **Content Embeddings**: Each movie and TV show is processed through Google's text-embedding-004 model, which analyzes titles, descriptions, and genres to create high-dimensional vector representations

2. **Search Embeddings**: User search queries are converted into embeddings and compared against content embeddings using cosine similarity (via PostgreSQL's pgvector extension)

3. **User Profile Embeddings**: The system aggregates a user's interaction history (weighted by action type) to generate a dynamic user profile embedding that represents their preferences

4. **Recommendation Engine**: Uses vector distance calculations to find content most similar to a user's profile, filtered by genre and popularity when needed

This approach enables the platform to understand semantic relationships between content and user preferences, delivering recommendations that go beyond simple genre or keyword matching.
